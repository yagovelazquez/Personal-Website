          <BodyTitle>Studious JavaScript enthusiast.</BodyTitle>
          <BodyParagraph>Although I chose to do the mechanical engeneering, I come from a family of developers and always liked to program, but it was since last year I started to take it more serious and learn better javascript.</BodyParagraph>
          <BodyParagraph>Since the beggining I felt in love with programming and understood that this was what I wanted. I'm willing to work and study on my free time (apart of work) the amount of hours that it takes to learn and be an useful asset to your company.</BodyParagraph>
          <BodyParagraph>I do believe that nowdays you can learn much on internet, and I've always been self taught. That's how apart of learning for the university and programming, I learnt english, spanish and have a very good understanding of italian. When you're not finding me programming, you can find me studying languages or exercising.</BodyParagraph>
          <BodyParagraph>If youâ€™d like to find out more about me, don't hesitate to get in touch with me <Link style={{ textDecoration: 'none'  }} to="./contact">here </Link> or sending an email to yagovelazquezsouzaa@gmail.com. Additionally, all my details are available on my <Link style={{ textDecoration: 'none', marginLeft: "4px"  }} to="/CVYago Velazquez.pdf" target="_blank" download>
